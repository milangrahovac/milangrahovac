## About Me

I'm an IT specialist with over 6 years of diverse experience in the field. My career journey has taken me through various roles, including working on an IT helpdesk, being part of an IT infrastructure team, and currently serving in the Endpoint team. Each of these positions has allowed me to develop a wide array of skills and expertise.

I have worked with several tools and technologies, such as Google Admin, Slack Admin, and Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions like Kandji, Intune, and Meraki. My responsibilities have included preparing laptops, creating accounts, onboarding and offboarding users, and maintaining server rooms and network equipment.

In addition I have developed a solid foundation in scripting and programming. I regularly write Bash and PowerShell scripts, and I also code in Python and have a basic understanding of Go. My knowledge extends to MySQL and frontend technologies like HTML5 and CSS. 

I enjoy diving deeper into coding projects, often experimenting with Arduino and Raspberry Pi and solving tasks on the LeetCode.com. I am also dedicated to continuous learning, frequently taking online courses to enhance my skills and stay updated with the latest advancements in the IT industry. I've recently been exploring GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, Go, and Django. You can find some examples of my Python code for the LeetCode coding challenges here: github.com/milangrahovac/leetcode-python

I am open to new opportunities for long-term professional development and growth.Â
